            <h2>When? Where? How?</h2>
            <p>We have 3 trips planned that are coming up and you can choose them right now! If you are interested in any of the below, please don't be afraid to contact us! </p>
            <br>
            <p>On December 1st - December 3rd, we will be going to Fernie, which is located in the beautiful, British Columbia. 
                British Columbia is well known for their mountains and this isn't a trip you would want to miss! </p>
            <br>
            <p>From February 26th - February 28th, we will be going Kicking Horse. Although, not as nice as Fernie, it is cheaper, so if you don't 
                want to miss out on some fun, come join us on this one! </p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, from May 15th - May 18th, we will be going to Revelstoke. If you never went snowboarding when it's hot out, then now is the time to 
                try! There are some cool experiences you can definitely try like snowboarding on water! This is one of our more popular choices!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Again, if you are interested, please contact us for more information! Hope to see you there!</p>
